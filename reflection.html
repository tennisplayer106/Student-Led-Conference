        My Journey Through SLC!
    </h1>

    

    <p>
        This SLC was the best in my entire life because in this one, I worked on a product i had barely learned a few days 
        ago; Making a website. It was very fun coding it because it is very different then the PowerPoint
        Presentations we use to make before which created a very new experience for me as my knowledge just
        blasted through the sky with me almost becoming really good at HTMl. I also included 'interaction' between users
        in the website which made it a more out of the ordinary. In conlusion my journey through this SLC was the best
        and I hope to explore more mediums and create the best products possible.
