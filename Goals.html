        My Goals!
    </h1>

    <h2>
        Goal 1 (Overall goal)
    </h2>

    <p>
        My overall goal is to get back to my regular fitness level before the lockdown.	Specific strategies I will use for the goal is to start running/jogging for 1 hour straight with cooldown exercises and stretching in the end.

Another strategy I can use is to eat healthy food because lately I have been consuming a a lot of chips, pizzas and stuff.	It will take at least two months with Parent reminders.	It will be evident in me being not lazy.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Goal 2 (English)
    </h2>

    <p>
        I need to work on creating organizational structures to present my work and use the feedback given in-class interactions and assessments.As suggested by MS Shivangani, I must add some literary and non-literary books to my reading list to improve my analysis and interpretation of texts.

I can also do redrafts to improve my grades further on. I can again write some paragraphs on my own and show it to ma’am ask if I have made some improvements in my writing which will take atleast one month.	The only support I need is from ms Shivangani to check and give feedback if I am really improving or not.	The evidence will be my grades
    </p>

    <h2>
        Goal 3 (Science)
    </h2>

    <p>
        I need to read the questions carefully before answering them in the class tasks. I can attempt some questions on my own and inquire further about subjects taught in class.

I can also do redrafts to fix a problem and not leave it behind, never to be answered. 	1 month is all i need and the support I need is from ma’am answering my doubts if I got any.The evidence will be present in my grades.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Goal 4 (Design)
    </h2>

    <p>
        I need to work on understanding each criterion in the design cycle strand by strand to be aware of the unit requirements. (Design)	For this, the only strategy available is that to learn and revise the criterions, command terms and strands very carefully.

        I can also do redrafts as a form of learning my mistakes on my own using the teacher’s feedback	1 month	All support I need is again from the teacher to resolve my questions about the subject.	The evidence will be present in my grades
