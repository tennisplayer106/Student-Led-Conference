        ATL Skills I Developed!
    </h1>

    <h2>
        1. Research Skills.
    </h2>

    <strong>
        I think I developed this skill because this year was full of researching. We had no so many activities
        in all of the classes that included researching helped develop this skills. Debating also helped me develop it
        because we need a development in this skill in order to bring out the best facts possible to win.
    </strong>
        
   <h2>
       2. Communication Skills
   </h2>   

   <strong>
       I think I developed this skill because as I went through this year, i participated in many competitions
       which was debating majorly. I had to improve my way of speaking in order to achieve the best speaker award,
       which i did in behes 9.0. This truly helped me develop this skill because there was no other communication happening
       in online school because we cant meet our friends or teachers to communicate our doubts properly or have a fun little chat.
