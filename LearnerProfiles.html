        Learner Profiles I Developed!
    </h1>

    <h2>
        1. Communicator.
    </h2>

    <strong>
        I think I developed this learner profile because I did many debates this year. I went through different
        rounds, with different people, with different topics to speak on, improving my way of speaking. All of
        this contributed into making me a better communicator with the confidence to speak infront
        of a mass.
    </strong>
        
   <h2>
       2. Knowledgeable.
   </h2>   

   <strong>
       I think I developed this learner profile because as I progressed through this year, i learned a lot 
       technology, new academic topics and a lot from outside the school from debating. All of these exanded my
       knowledge, my thought process and information on the current world, about a current scenario and about 
       different things which are becoming serious.
   </strong>

   <h2> 
       3. Inquirer
   </h2>

   <strong>
       This year, I have inquired upon many topics mostly in debating in order to come up with points to
       prove my stand. I have been delving deeper into topics taught in school and learning more about them 
       which was previously unknown to me.
