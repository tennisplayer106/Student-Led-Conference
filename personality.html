        Personality Test!
    </h1>

    <p>
        So recently, Dimple ma'am asked us all to do a personality test for our SLC. It was a website
        with 80 questions which i answered. Here are the results below the text. Over here my intelligence is highly
        superior in logic and kinesthetic meaning that i like to more around a lot and I use logic to answer my questions. After
        Analyzing the results a bit, I think i am good in the fields of logic and Maths and should pursue my career according to
        that.
