    The Subjects I Like!
</h1>

<p>
    The subjects I like the most is I&S and Maths because I am very good at them and i have a interest
    which is never going to stop. These two got many interesting topics which I have explored
    or are yet to be explored. I score good in them which keeps my interest in those subjects 
    immortal. I am more of a logical person which makes me like maths and not be scared of it
    because i find it very easy and never to be boring. I like I&S for one main reason, which 
    is Nature and History. I spend so many hours of my daily life reading history books because of
    which my general knowledge is really good. I am a nature lover and likes to observe animal behaiviour,
    on what conditions they live in, adaptations and so much more! I also like to see beautiful wonders of
    the earth like the Himalayas, The Amazon rainforest and so much more! There is always a spark of
    enjoyment which is hidden in these 2 subjects which make them special for me.
